Udemy.com V3 doesn't support variable speed video playback. I can't stand listening to most video at 1.0x but fortunately Udemy V3 uses the HTML5 <video> element so it's super easy to adjust playback speed anyways.

To install this bookmarklet:
1) Copy the contents of "bookmarklet.js" to your clipboard (cmd-c or control-c typically)
  - for example, copy the line of text that looks like this:
    javascript:void((function(){document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].playbackRate=prompt('How fast do you want to go?', '1.618');})());
2) In your browser, create a new bookmark, and paste this text as the bookmark URL/location
3) Give the bookmark a name (if applicable) and save it

To use:
When viewing an HTML5 video that is not in an IFrame, you can use this bookmarklet to change the speed if speed controls are not otherwise available
