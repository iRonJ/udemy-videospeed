Udemy.com V3 doesn't support variable speed video playback. I can't stand listening to most video at 1.0x but fortunately Udemy V3 uses the HTML5 <video> element so it's super easy to adjust playback speed anyways.

[drag this bookmarklet](javascript:void((function(){document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].playbackRate=prompt('How fast do you want to go?', '1.618');})());) to your browser's bookmark toolbar to use.
